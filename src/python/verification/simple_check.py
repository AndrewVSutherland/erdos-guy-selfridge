# This program checks that a file containing a putative factorization
# of N! into F factors, each of which is at least M, is correct.

# If no file is provided, it reads from standard input.  If the flag
# "-s" is given, then it checks a subfactorization.

# If the factorization is correct, the program simply prints "N F M".

# The program is designed to be very simple to read so that it's very
# obvious what it does.  A more efficient approach might be to check
# that the prime factors up to N appear the correct number of times.
# It might also be useful in the future to allow for subfactorizations
# of N!.

# The file format is a bunch of whitespace-separated integers.  The
# first three integers are N, F, and M in that order.  Then there
# should be F integers which are the factors themselves, in any order,
# each of which should be at least M.

# Here is an example file for 20! factored as 20 terms, each of which
# is at least 6:

# 20 20 6
# 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
# 7 7
# 8 8
# 10 10 10 10
# 11 13 17 19
