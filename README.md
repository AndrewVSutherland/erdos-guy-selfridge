For a natural number $N$, let $t(N)$ be the largest number such that $N!$ can be factored into $N$ integer factors, each of which is at least $t(N)$.  It is known that $t(N) = N/e + o(N)$ as $N \to \infty$, answering a question of [Erd≈ës and Graham](https://www.erdosproblems.com/391); see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20170).  This repository records the efforts to verify the [Guy-Selfridge conjectures](https://zbmath.org/0918.11013):

1. $t(N) \geq \lfloor 2N/7 \rfloor$ for all $N \neq 56$.
2. $t(N) \geq N/3$ for all $N \geq 3 \times 10^5$.  How small can the lower threshold $3 \times 10^5$ be?

A secondary goal is

3.  Extend the values of $t(N)$ reported in the OEIS (which currently [go up to $N \leq 79$](https://oeis.org/A034258/b034258.txt)).

## Current status

1. Conjecture 1 has been reduced to Conjecture 2.
2. Conjecture 2 is known in the range $8 \times 10^4 \leq N \leq 10^9$, and for sufficiently large $N$.
3. Some lower and upper bounds on $t(N)$ are known beyond $N=79$, but the OEIS table has not yet been extended.
