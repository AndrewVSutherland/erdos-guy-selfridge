# Verifying the Guy-Selfridge conjecture

For a natural number $N$, let $t(N)$ be the largest number such that $N!$ can be factored into $N$ integer factors, each of which is at least $t(N)$.  [It is known](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20170) that $\frac{1}{e} - \frac{O(1)}{\log N} \leq \frac{t(N)}{N} \leq \frac{1}{e} - \frac{c_0+o(1)}{\log N}$,
where $c_0 := \frac{1}{e} \int_0^1 \left \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor \log \left( ex \left \lceil \frac{1}{ex} \right\rceil \right)\ dx = 0.3044\dots,$
answering a question of [Erd≈ës and Graham](https://www.erdosproblems.com/391).  

Here is a graph of the integral defining $c_0$:

And here is a plot of $t(N)/N$ against some comparators for $N \leq 79$:

Here is an extension of that image to $N \leq 200$:

A view of $80 \leq N \leq 599$ (using a greedy lower bound for $t(N)$):

An enlargement of the previous graph, also including the greedy algorithm lower bound:

This repository records the efforts to verify the [Guy-Selfridge conjectures](https://zbmath.org/0918.11013) concerning the sequence $t(N)$:

1. $t(N) \geq \lfloor 2N/7 \rfloor$ for all $N \neq 56$.
2. $t(N) \geq N/3$ for all $N \geq 3 \times 10^5$.  How small can the lower threshold $3 \times 10^5$ be?

(A further conjecture of Guy and Selfridge that $t(N) \leq N/e$ for $N \neq 1,2,4$ [has been solved](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20170).) 

Secondary goals are

3.  Extend the values of $t(N)$ reported in the OEIS (which [are listed up to](https://oeis.org/A034258/b034258.txt))  $N \leq 79$, and which can be extended to $N \leq 200$ by inverting [OEIS A034259](https://oeis.org/A034259).
4.  Obtain more accurate values for $c_0$.


## Current status

1. Conjecture 1 has been reduced to Conjecture 2.
2. Conjecture 2 is known in the range $8 \times 10^4 \leq N \leq 10^9$, and for sufficiently large $N$.  The approximation $\frac{t(N)}{N} \approx \frac{1}{e} - \frac{c_0}{\log N}$ suggests that the threshold is approximately $6700$.
3. The OEIS tables have been extended to $N \leq 600$.
4. Non-rigorous numerics have shown that $c_0 \approx 0.3044$.
