# Verifying the Guy-Selfridge conjecture

For a natural number $N$, let $t(N)$ be the largest number such that $N!$ can be factored into $N$ integer factors, each of which is at least $t(N)$.  It is known that $\frac{1}{e} - \frac{c_0+O(\log^{-c} N)}{\log N} \leq \frac{t(N)}{N} \leq \frac{1}{e} - \frac{c_0}{\log N} -\frac{c_1+o(1)}{\log^2 N}$,
where $c_0 := \frac{1}{e} \int_0^1 \left \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor \log \left( ex \left \lceil \frac{1}{ex} \right\rceil \right)\ dx = 0.304419010\dots,$
answering a question of [Erd≈ës and Graham](https://www.erdosproblems.com/391).  Here $c_1$ is the explicit constant $c_1 := c^\prime_1 + c_0 {c_1}^{\prime\prime} - ec_0^2/2 = 0.75554808\dots$, where ${c_1}^\prime := \frac{1}{e} \int_0^1 \left \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor \log \left( ex \left \lceil \frac{1}{ex} \right\rceil \right) \log \frac{1}{x}\ dx = 0.3702051\dots$ and ${c_1}^{\prime\prime} :=  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}  \log\left( \frac{e}{k} \left\lceil \frac{k}{e} \right\rceil \right) = 1.679587996\dots$. 

Here is a graph of the integral defining $c_0$:

And here is a plot of $t(N)/N$ against some comparators for $N \leq 79$:

Here is an extension of that image to $N \leq 200$:

This repository records the efforts to verify the [Guy-Selfridge conjectures](https://zbmath.org/0918.11013) concerning the sequence $t(N)$:

1. $t(N) \geq \lfloor 2N/7 \rfloor$ for all $N \neq 56$.
2. $t(N) \geq N/3$ for all $N \geq 3 \times 10^5$.  How small can the lower threshold $3 \times 10^5$ be?

(A further conjecture of Guy and Selfridge that $t(N) \leq N/e$ for $N \neq 1,2,4$ [has been solved](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20170).) 

Secondary goals are

3.  Extend the values of $t(N)$ reported in the OEIS (which [are listed up to](https://oeis.org/A034258/b034258.txt))  $N \leq 79$, and which can be extended to $N \leq 200$ by inverting [OEIS A034259](https://oeis.org/A034259).
4.  Obtain more accurate values for $c_0$ and $c_1$.


## Current status

1. Conjecture 1 **has been fully verified**, as a consequence of Conjecture 2 for $N \geq 43632$, and either the greedy or linear programming method for $N < 43632$.
2. Conjecture 2 **has been verified** for all $N \geq 43632$, and is known to fail for $N = 43631$.  For $N \leq 8 \times 10^4$; these facts can be obtained by a linear programming method; for $8 \times 10^4 < N \leq 10^{11}$ by a modified greedy method; and for $N \geq 10^{11}$ by a modified approximate factorization method. A separate modified greedy method has verified the range $10^6 \leq N \leq 10^{12}$.  The smallest $N$ for which the conjecture holds (excluding the small cases $N=1,2,3,4,5,6,9$) is $N=41006$.  
3. The OEIS tables have been extended to $N \leq 10000$ by the linear programming method (combined with integer programming to handle a few rare cases where the linear programming bounds are not tight).
4. Using interval arithmetic and rigorous error bounds, one has $c_0 = 0.304419010\dots$ and $c_1 = 0.75554808\dots$.Non-rigorous heuristic calculations predict that $c_0 \approx 0.30441901087$.
